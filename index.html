                    <p class="sub_description">Sociology and theology both show that unfair gender norms can harm people. Sociology points out issues like domestic violence, unequal work and family expectations, and restrictive roles, while theology sees these as going against God's design. Both perspectives call for dignity, respect, and fairness. Some sociological points, like bias against women and LGBTQ groups, felt exaggerated in everyday life, but I understand that subtle inequalities still exist. On the theological side, it was eye-opening to see how some people twist Scripture to justify inequality, highlighting the importance of interpreting God's Word correctly.
                    <br><br>    
                    I still believe that the government and the church mostly provide moral guidance, but even good institutions can unintentionally reinforce bias. Scripture is reliable, but human interpretation is not always trustworthy. Gender norms aren't automatically harmful, but misuse of power and cultural pressure can cause real problems. My responsibility is to treat everyone with respect while staying true to God's teachings, avoiding judgment, and not following trends that blur moral lines. I can't fix all societal inequalities, but I can influence how I speak, act, vote, and interact with others, living with integrity and honoring God's design.

                    <p class="sub_description">Looking at gender norms, I see that both sociology and theology give important insights, even if they approach the topic differently. Sociology shows that gender roles are socially constructed and shaped by culture, institutions, media, and policies. Laws, educational systems, and government programs like maternity leave or reproductive rights can reinforce traditional roles or     encourage equality. Intersectionality also matters: gender interacts with race, class, and sexuality, so understanding norms requires looking at these overlapping influences. Media and institutional messages influence public perception, and both government and religious institutions play a role in shaping what is considered normal or acceptable for men and women.
                    <br><br>    
                    Theology adds another layer, showing how religious teachings shape ideas of gender. Some interpretations reinforce traditional roles, while others promote equality based on modern understandings of faith. Church teachings influence how people view family, work, and community involvement, and religious communities create a collective identity that can either support or challenge inequality. Reflecting on this, I realize that both the government and church carry responsibilities to guide norms carefully. My personal mandate is to act responsibly in everyday life: recognize cultural influences, respect individual dignity, engage critically with policies and teachings, and encourage fairness in my interactions. While I can't change every rule or interpretation, I can model respect, equity, and integrity in my own choices, helping to balance societal and religious expectations.

                        <p class="sub_description">Through this study, I realized that both sociology and theology emphasize the importance of respecting everyone's dignity regardless of gender. Sociology points out how social systems, cultural expectations, and government policies can create unfair roles, like limiting opportunities for women or putting pressure on men to fit certain ideals. Theology, on the other hand, reminds me that everyone is created in God's image, so discrimination or harmful stereotypes go against His plan. I also noticed some tensions: while sociology sees gender as socially flexible, traditional theological interpretations often hold to fixed roles, and some teachings, like parts of Ephesians 5, have been used in ways that restrict women's roles. This made me think carefully about what beliefs are truly biblical and what comes from culture.
                        <br><br>
                        Reflecting on this, I understand that some norms come from society rather than God, and that structural inequalities still affect real people. Sociology helped me see how these patterns operate, while theology keeps me grounded in the equal worth of every person. My personal mandate is to act intentionally with fairness and respect: challenging harmful stereotypes, treating people equally in school and community settings, examining Scripture thoughtfully, supporting leaders who promote justice, and honoring boundaries in relationships. I know I can't change every system, but I can make choices that reflect integrity, compassion, and God's design for human dignity.
